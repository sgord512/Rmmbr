Also, I am having a weird issue where ghc generates a stupendously long list of warnings during linking. This causes the make to fail, but it works fine if I symlink my toolbox in, and then make it in ghc.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Features that I want to implement:

Interactive removal, with different colors, and the ability to enter ranges or from the end again. 
	    I can probably repurpose my parser for that, and then just do some color stuff, shouldn't be that hard.

Having meaningful sort order, so that you can sort by different criteria, and then do operations on the lists just as you would normally.

Deadlines would be nice, but they are not essential from my point of view. (Maybe add this later)

I should have it do a copyright, license, blah, blah display when it is run. (Later)

Also, I should figure out what to do with Toolbox, which doesn't really belong where it is, and which is kind of a wimp.

Make sure to track bugs.

Also, I should figure out a way to test all of this junk.

Right now, I can do it manually, but it is about reaching the end of that phase.

TODOS:

Then, fit those into lists. 

Ok, so how do I want to deal with adding entries and specifying importance and comments.

I guess I should first implement a "comment and comment-list"

To do that I should do some refactoring so that I don't have to manually deal with validating lists all the time. This should make some other stuff easier as well. DONE

Also, I should refactor the removeElementFromList thing so that less of that logic is contained in the command and so that I can just specify behavior there, and not have to deal with the specifics so much. DONE

Commenting now works, and you can begin and complete things. DONE

Next up, implement some different sort orders, and then implement verbosity.

KNOWN BUGS GO HERE: 

it will always record the time that you entered something in UTC, without the right time zone, which is annoying, but it turns out to be actually quite difficult to figure out what is a better alternative, because what do you want to do if someone is adding something in multiple time zones?
